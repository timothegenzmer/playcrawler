# playcrawler
Basic Crawler for the Google Play Store  

This Crawler will download Top Lists, Apps, Similar Apps and Developer Apps. They are saved in a Sqlite File, although changing the Database is pretty simple

## Installation
Gradle is used as a build system.
Many IDEs support gradle and will install all dependencies.
To just build it run ./gradlew assemble

## Contribution
I'm looking forward to all kind of contribution. Bug Reports, Feature Requests or even Pull Requests.
